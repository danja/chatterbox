Trying to get a clean wavetable-generated waveform, pitch controlled by a pot.

I've got two threads running, one reading from ADC, one sending wavetable value to DAC. 

The max freq at present is 3.5kHz, relatively clean. But dropping pitch makes it full of strange artifacts.

This is at 1kHz :

Two likely causes - 

1. the looping around the wavetable has timing issues.
2. the ESP32 docs say the ADCs can be prone to noise

I've got a bit ahead of myself. Reckon I should dummy-out the ADC reading to isolate the timing. 

Later... that made no difference. Finally spotted a *hilarious* oversight. The sine wave I was putting into the wavetable was from sin(0) to sin(TABLESIZE), not sin(0) to sin(2*PI)!

Much, much better. Good enough for now.

**NB.** the docs suggest putting a 100n capacitor across the ADC input(s) to reduce noise - this actually seemed to make it worse.

Ok, the current freq range is around 100Hz - 8kHz. A bit warbly when changing freq.

For testing purposes I've added code to fill the wavetable with sine, square, sawtooth, triangle, or 'larynx' waveforms, according to the position of another pot. (This might be nice to have user-selectable in final version? Maybe add an LCD display? scope creep...).

The other waveforms are more glitchy, to varying degrees.

This paper looks promising for tricks to reduce aliasing artifacts : [Table Lookup Oscillators Using Generic Integrated Wavetables](http://mtg.upf.edu/node/485)

Also discovered [Faust](https://faust.grame.fr/), DSP/synth kit, has support for ESP32. Looks awesome, but as one of my motivations for doing this is to learn the details of signal processing on little devices, I'm going to continue from scratch. Is fun!
