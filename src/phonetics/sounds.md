1.Almost all dictionaries use the e symbol for the vowel in BED. The problem with this convention is that e in the IPA does not stand for the vowel in BED; it stands for a different vowel that is heard, for example, in the German word SEELE. The “proper” symbol for the BED-vowel is ɛ (do not confuse with ɜ:). The same goes for eə vs. ɛə.

2.In əʳ and ɜ:ʳ, the ʳ is not pronounced in BrE, unless the sound comes before a vowel (as in ANSWERING, ANSWER IT). In AmE, the ʳ is always pronounced, and the sounds are sometimes written as ɚ and ɝ.

3.In AmE, ɑ: and ɒ are one vowel, so CALM and COT have the same vowel. In American transcriptions, HOT is written as hɑ:t.

4.About 40% of Americans pronounce ɔ: the same way as ɑ:, so that CAUGHT and COT have the same vowel. See cot-caught merger.

5.In American transcriptions, ɔ: is often written as ɒ: (e.g. LAW = lɒ:), unless it is followed by r, in which case it remains an ɔ:.

6.In British transcriptions, oʊ is usually represented as əʊ. For some BrE speakers, oʊ is more appropriate (they use a rounded vowel) — for others, the proper symbol is əʊ. For American speakers, oʊ is usually more accurate.

7.In eəʳ ɪəʳ ʊəʳ, the r is not pronounced in BrE, unless the sound comes before a vowel (as in DEAREST, DEAR ANN). In AmE, the r is always pronounced, and the sounds are often written as er ɪr ʊr.

8.All dictionaries use the r symbol for the first sound in RED. The problem with this convention is that r in the IPA does not stand for the British or American R; it stands for the “hard” R that is heard, for example, in the Spanish word REY or Italian VERO. The “proper” symbol for the RED-consonant is ɹ. The reason r is used instead is that it’s easier to type and read.

9.In American English, t is often pronounced as a flap t, which sounds like d or (more accurately) like the quick, hard r heard e.g. in the Spanish word PERO. For example: LETTER. Some dictionaries use the t ̬ symbol for the flap t.
