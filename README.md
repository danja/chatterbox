# Chatterbox
*A manually controlled speech-like sound generator*

Based on ESP32 with external UDA1334A DAC. Work in progress.

## Introduction

Not long ago I rediscovered an electronics magazine article I first saw whilst still at school, around 1979 : [Chatterbox](https://github.com/danja/chatterbox/blob/master/reference/Chatterbox-1976.pdf). It was a design for a simple speech synthesizer, controlled by means of a joystick, switches etc. I wanted to build one then; now ever more so.

The (mighty elegant) implementation then was with a handful of ICs, now I'd like to try something similar based around microcontroller(s). Also ties in nicely with other projects I have on the go.

The rationale for having such a machine is well made in the magazine article. But given a microcontroller, it should be relatively straightforward to add features such as MIDI I/O interface to make it a modern musical instrument, Web interface for the IoT, whatever. Should be fun.

## Status

**2020-03-05** : All available pots set to filter controls, using a state variable. Between stages have added soft clipping (tanh), works a treat! 

**2020-03-03** : **Milestone!** first formant filter essentially working.

**2020-02-02** : I've got pot 5 controlling the pitch of a wavetable-generated larynx-like tone. Pot 4 controls the waveform. (Switch 0 is hooked up to change between test waveforms).
First attempts at a filter, cutoff freq on pot 3. Something very wrong - it's industrial noises in a box. Well, pulsed farty noises...

**2020-02-29** : I now have the main controls hooked into the code : joystick, 4x potentiometers, 5x push-button switches. Of these only 2 pots and 1 switch are actually doing anything. 

2020-02-26 : First prototype case with controls put together ([Front panel v1.0](https://github.com/danja/chatterbox/blob/master/media/front-panel_v1.png "Front panel v1.0")). Digging into software.

**2020-02-21** : First sounds from core hard/software (stereo 7kHz sine from wavetable @ 44.1kHz, 16 bit). This repository created.

## Proposed Implementation    

The human interface is probably the most appealing part of the original Chatterbox. So joystick, bunch of switches, a few pots. Use an inexpensive microcontroller to do the work.

* Hardware : currently I'm looking at an ESP32 module, plus an external UDA1334A DAC module (using I2S). Old-school analog joystick, pots & switches. 

* Software : Initial larynx/glottal sounds, wavetable is fast & easy. Formants (essentially tuned filters mimicing the tubes around throat, mouth, nose), I'm quite entranced by the Swiss Army Knife DSP design. Make a little lib based on that, plug together. 

## Considerations
The 12-bit ADCs of the ESP32 should be adequate for analog input from joystick & a few pots. Hopefully, given an external DAC, 16 bit output signal shouldn't be too demanding. 

A potential issue is performance on the ESP32. The 7kHz @ 44.1kHz sine I got out of the box was generated using floats with minimal arithmetic. The original Chatterbox employed 5 formant filters, the computational demand of those (plus sound generation, interface recognition) might get heavy. 

* Plan B is to use fixed-point arithmetic for the DSP calculations. Potentially orders of magnitude speed increase in speed of calculations, at the cost of spending lots of time figuring it all out.

* Plan C is to use an Arduino Due, considerably faster than the ESP32 but with expense, leaning to the point of might-as-well-use-a-Raspberry Pi.

* Plan D is to drop all this, use a mobile phone, laptop. And/or, game handset.
